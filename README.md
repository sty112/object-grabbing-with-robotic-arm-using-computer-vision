# object-grabbing-with-robotic-arm-using-computer-vision

Introduction:
This is a capstone project for my mechanical engineering course, the purpose of the project is to aid childrens in tidying up their table after they finish playing their legos or blocks as children would always have the tendency to just leave it there. So our solution is to make a robotic arm that can detect colors and shapes of the block so that it could classify them and put them back into their respective places.
